# Device-Security-Face-Verification
Micrsoft Engage project

This is a simple app which shows the use of device verification using face recognition.

I have uploaded the app on Googel Play store
Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silverstudio.devicesecurity

To build the project, open it in the latest android studio and run it.

Note: No need to update values which I have mentioned in the video
as I have already added them.

It has One activity and four fragments

1. LoginFragment => To login user with google
2. HomeFragment => To edit and save secret note
3. AddFaceFragment => To add face for verification
4. VerifyFaceFragment => To verify face and grant access to user
